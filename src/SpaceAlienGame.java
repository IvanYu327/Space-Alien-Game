 Java, JavaSE-1.8
==============================================================================================================================================================
Problem Definition 	ï¿½ Write a program that randomly generates aliens on a Cartesian plane and alien locations never repeat in a game. The user must enter the
coordinates of the alien as fast as possible. Correct answers get points and answering speed can get points depending on the user's response time. Users must 
to able to see their current scores and highscores during the game as well as review all the alien locations once the game time is up. Scores must be 
automatically updated to a highscore board and the user should have an option to save their highscores to a text file or upload a text file with highscores
from a previous session.

Input 		- User input required determine their username, quit the game, view the rules of the game, view the leaderboards, start the game, enter their
x and y coordinates for the alien, submitting their final answer for the x y coordinates of the alien, returning to the menu, creating a new highscore file
in a user specified location, retrieving a previous highscore file and saving the current highscores to a file selected.

Output	 	- The program outputs a user friendly menu that allows the user to quit, see rules, see highscores, start a game, or change their username. Program
can display the rules to the game and the current highscore standings. If a game is started, the program displays a grid with a single alien, text fields for the user
to enter their answer of the x y coordinates of the alien displayed and a button to submit their answer. Once an answer is submitted, the program displays message 
that tells the user if their answer was correct or not. Based on the correctness, the program also displays the user's current points and stats 
such as the number of aliens missed, caught, percentage accuracy, average time for a correct catch. Once the game time is up, the program displays the user's stats 
containing the same details mentioned earlier. It also displays a grid containing all the alien locations for that game.

Process 	- Determines if the user wants to go to the rules page, start a game, view the highscores, enter a new username, or quit the game. Randomly generates
aliens on a Cartesian Plane and makes sure not to repeat it within the same game. Program determines if user input of x y coordinates is correct and incorrect and
awards points accordingly, updating the number of aliens spawned, caught, percentage accuracy, average time for a correct catch, and points. At the same time, 
the program keeps track of how much game time is left. If game time runs out, the program ends the game and moves onto user stats and alien location review. 
Program also keeps track of how long each alien has been on the game grid. If the user takes too long to answer, the program gives a new alien and counts the 
previous as a missed/incorrect answer. Once the game ends, the program determines if the user's current score is higher than any of the current highscores. If so,
the program inserts the user's score and username into the appropriate location and shifts the consecutive scores down one spot, deleting the 10th place highscore.
On the highscore page, the program determines if the user want to create, retrieve, or save the current highscores. If the user wants to create a new file, the
program allows the user to choose a folder location and creates a text file with the current highscores. If the user wants to retrieve scores, the program lets
the user choose a file and checks if the file is compatible/acceptable and responds accordingly to unsupported file types. If accepted, the overwrites the current
highscores (if there are any) with the ones on the retrieved text file. If the user wants to save the current scores and a text file has been selected, the program 
overwrites the file chosen and replaces it with the current standings. If no file has been selected, the program cannot save and displays an error message.
